# Grade-Processing-System

Worked on this personal project right before taking the second Intro to Object Oriented Programming class (Before sophomore year).

Fully functional grade processing system using the console's standard input/output in Java, using ArrayLists and OOP principles.
Keeps track of individual assignments for multiple classes & calculates weighted final grades.
Ability to view class grades, add/edit/remove assignments to multiple classes, and add/remove classes.
